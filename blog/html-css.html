          The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding
        </h1>
        <p id="main-content">
          These three are very important properties in CSS which we use to
          position html contents (body, paragraph, lists and footers etc.) on
          the web page. Good understanding of these will surely help you to make
          better design choices for any webpage. In CSS a margin is the space
          outside of the element’s border and where padding is space inside of
          the border, between content and border. And the border is sort of
          separator of both which exists between margin and padding. I have shown
          some photo for better understanding.
          
        </p>

        <ul class="tips-list">
          <li>
            <h2>Margin</h2>
            <p>
              it is the space outside of element’s border. It helps to improve
              the visibility of the element by separating its own elements from
              the surrounding ones. This prevents the element touching and
              overlapping others.
            </p>
            <p>
              margin: 10px; this code adds 10pixels of margin on each side of
              the element.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/10pxmargin.png"
              alt="image showing dedicated learning space"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Border</h2>
            <p>
              it is a line that surrounds the padding and content of the element
              and exits between margin and padding and acts as a separator
              between both. We also use border to create outline around the
              element. We can adjust the width style and color etc. of border.
            </p>
            <p>
              Border:2px solid black; this code block adds 2 pixels of solid
              black border around the element.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/example.png"
              alt="image showing margin border padding and content"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Padding</h2>
            <p>
              It is space inside the border, between border and element’s
              content. It stops the content to touching the border line for
              better readability and visibility in the content such as images
              and text.
            </p>
            Padding:10px; it adds 10pixels of space inside te border of all
            sides of the content.
            <p></p>
            <img src="/images/padding.png" alt="image showing padding" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Analogy</h2>
            We can use room analogy for explaining margin, border, padding and content. Content (text, images, element etc.) is like a furniture inside the room, padding is space inside the room between furniture and the wall, it adds the breathing space around the content. Border is like walls of the room as wall encloses the free space and furniture, border encloses the padding and the content. Margin can be space like yard outside that keep our room apart from neighboring rooms.
          </li>
            <h1 class="main-heading">To sum up</h1>
            <p id="main-content">
              Margin controls the space outside of an element. Border is space
              between margin and padding and can also be used and line around
              the padding. Padding adjusts the space inside the elements between
              border and content. The main use of these properties are make the
              webpage appealing and improving the functional layout.
