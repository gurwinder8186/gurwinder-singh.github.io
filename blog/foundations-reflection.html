          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          Through the Human Skills learning, I’ve discovered a few key insights
          about myself and how my ego might play a role. I tend to focus heavily
          on my own work, preferring to work independently and paying less
          attention to seeking or offering help or interacting with others. This
          could be driven by a subtle desire to prove my capabilities without
          needing external assistance. I've also realized that I often neglect
          my health and mindfulness, pushing through long study sessions without
          taking proper breaks, which may reflect a drive to achieve results
          quickly, even at the expense of my well-being. Lastly, I’ve noticed
          that I sometimes struggle with distractions while studying on the
          computer, often getting sidetracked by videos or content that is
          unrelated to studies that pulls me away from focused work. This
          balance between wanting to stay productive and giving in to these
          distractions reflects a challenge in managing both focus and
          ego-driven goals.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-heading" id="main-heading-h2">
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          Values, empathy, and self-awareness play vital roles in both learning
          and programming. Values like integrity and discipline guide ethical
          decision-making and a commitment to high-quality work. Empathy allows
          programmers to understand user needs, collaborate effectively, and
          design solutions that are user-friendly and impactful. Self-awareness
          helps individuals recognize their strengths and areas for improvement,
          manage stress, and maintain a growth mindset. Together, these
          qualities foster a more thoughtful, ethical, and collaborative
          approach to problem-solving and personal development in programming.

          What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          What surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning is how much
          it influences programming, something I didn’t initially expect. At
          first, I thought programming was purely about problem-solving and
          technical skills, with no real connection to human skills. However, I
          quickly realized that applying mindfulness, self-awareness, taking
          breaks, and even incorporating focused exercises has a significant
          impact on productivity and the quality of my work. These skills help
          improve focus, reduce stress, and boost overall performance, making
          them essential for success in programming.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-heading" id="main-heading-h2">
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          The most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning for me were
          listening and looping, as it was difficult to give someone my full
          attention consistently—something I wasn’t used to doing in my daily
          routine. Additionally, practicing mindfulness through meditation
          proved to be both effective and challenging, as it wasn’t something I
          had incorporated into my routine before, making it harder to adjust
          to.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-heading" id="main-heading-h2">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          The main reason Dev Academy focuses so much on Human Skills learning
          in a web development Bootcamp is because, as explained in the
          Foundations, employers often value strong human skills more than
          technical ones. While technical skills can be taught relatively
          quickly, human skills—like communication, empathy, and mindfulness—are
          harder to develop but essential for workplace productivity and a
          positive environment. These skills not only improve collaboration and
          problem-solving in teams but also enhance focus and health, making the
          learning process more effective and sustainable in the long run.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-heading" id="main-heading-h2">
          Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice
          programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          I don’t think the time spent learning Human Skills was a waste at all.
          In fact, it was a great decision. It didn’t take away from learning
          programming but rather enhanced it by making the sessions more focused
          and attentive. Human skills are essential for success, especially in
          the workplace, as they complement technical abilities and improve
          productivity. I’m thankful that these skills were taught, as they are
          just as important for employment and professional growth as
          programming itself.
