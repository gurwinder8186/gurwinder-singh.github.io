          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss

          I made the ethical decision to become a baptized Sikh (5th largest
          religion originated from north India), choosing to live by principles
          such as avoiding greed, lust, ego, anger, and attachment. This
          decision involved reflecting on the values of humility, self-control,
          and integrity, and was driven by my belief that these principles lead
          to a meaningful life free from negative behaviors like comparison,
          plunders and backstabbing. While it is challenging, I believe this
          path brings true fulfillment and peace, aligning me with a higher
          purpose. Looking back, I am proud of this choice, as it has made my
          life better and helped me stay grounded and at peace.

        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          My culture and the people around me, especially my parents and
          siblings, have greatly influenced my values and identity, helping me
          become a more mature, caring, and respectful person. In our culture,
          it is highly valued to love, respect, and help those in need without
          expecting anything in return. I continue to work towards embodying
          these values for a more fulfilling and purposeful life.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          My strengths, such as having clear goals and avoiding diversions, will
          help me stay focused on my studies. My willingness to work hard
          supports spending intense hours on learning, and my openness to asking
          for help from facilitators and fellow students ensures I actively seek
          guidance and feedback when needed. These traits will be crucial in
          supporting my learning journey.

        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          Some of my limitations include spending too much time trying to solve
          problems on my own, which can be exhausting, not taking proper breaks
          or using short focused sessions, and staying away from study for
          extended periods, which affects my concentration and ability to grasp
          complex topics. Additionally, being overly concerned with new gadgets
          and technology can sometimes distract me and take time away from my
          studies. These habits can slow down my learning journey and reduce my
          effectiveness.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.

          While working as a fiber technician installing broadband, which
          involved hard, physically demanding tasks, I noticed some coworkers
          were not putting in the same effort as I did. To address this, I
          planned ahead and divided the work equally so everyone could
          contribute to their full capabilities, which led to significant
          progress. Reflecting on this, I now realize the importance of planning
          and will apply this by reviewing tasks at the beginning of the week
          and scheduling them with proper time allocation to achieve better
          results.
