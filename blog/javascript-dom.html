          <b>Javascript Fundamentals</b>
        </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 15px">
          As I began learning HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the Document Object Model (DOM), I felt
          overwhelmed by the technical jargons. With help from facilitators,
          fellow students, and my own research, I gained a basic understanding.
          Now, I want to explain the basics of JavaScript and the DOM in simple
          terms, with clear examples to help you understand better.

          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and

            Javascript, HTML and CSS</b
          ><br /><br />
          <b>HTML (Ingredients):</b> Think of HTML as the list of ingredients
          for a recipe. It provides the basic components you'll need to make
          your dish, such as flour, spices, sugar, and milk. <br />

          <b>CSS (Presentation):</b> CSS is like the presentation of the meal.
          It’s about how you plate and garnish the food, making it look
          appealing. CSS adds the finishing touches, such as how the meal is
          arranged on the plate, the color of the sauce, and the choice of
          garnishes. <br />

          <b>JavaScript (Cooking Instructions):</b> JavaScript is like the
          cooking instructions or the chef’s actions. It tells you how to mix
          the ingredients, adjust the heat, and perform tasks to turn raw
          ingredients into a delicious meal. It adds the interactive, dynamic
          elements that bring your dish to life—like stirring, baking, or
          flipping the food. <br />In summary, HTML provides the raw
          ingredients, CSS enhances the appearance, and JavaScript handles the
          cooking to make the meal ready and interactive.

          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life.
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          <b>Control flow</b> determines the sequence or pattern in which
          different steps or decisions are executed. To illustrate control flow,
          consider making a sandwich: <br />
          <b>1.</b> Decide if you want a sandwich. If yes, proceed; if no, stop.
          <br /><b>2.</b> Get the ingredients, such as bread and cheese. <br />
          <b>3.</b> Assemble the sandwich, adding the required fillings. <br />
          <b>4.</b> Serve or pack the sandwich. <br />In programming, control
          flow is managed using statements like if-else or switch, which decide
          what to do next based on certain conditions. <br /><br />
          <b>Loops</b> are used to perform repetitive actions. For instance, if
          you need to make sandwiches for a group of people: <br />
          <b>1.</b> Repeat the process for each sandwich. <br /><b>2.</b> Get
          ingredients for one sandwich. <br /><b>3.</b> Assemble and serve one
          sandwich. <br /><b>4.</b> Move to the next sandwich until all
          sandwiches are made. <br />In programming, this repetition is handled
          by a for loop to repeat a set number of times or a while loop to
          continue until a condition is met. <br /><br />
          In summary, making a sandwich involves a sequence of steps (control
          flow) and repeating those steps for multiple sandwiches (loops).
          Similarly, in programming, control flow directs the order of
          operations, while loops automate repetitive tasks

          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a framework that organizes a web
          page's content into a tree structure, where each element, attribute,
          and text is a separate node. This setup allows programming languages
          like JavaScript to dynamically interact with and alter the page’s
          layout, style, and content. <br /><img
            style="
              width: 100%;
              max-width: 900px;
              height: auto;
              border-radius: 7px;
              margin-top: 30px;
              display: block;
            "
            src="/images/Dom commands.png"
            alt="basic dom commands"
          /><br /><br />Essentially, the DOM provides a way to represent and
          manipulate a web page’s elements, enabling you to select, change, and
          respond to content and user interactions to create a more dynamic and
          engaging experience.

        <h2 class="main-heading" id="main-heading-h2">
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          Accessing data from arrays and objects in java take in different
          techniques due to their private structures. <b>Arrays</b> are ordered
          collections of items indexed by numerical values, starting from 0. You
          access array elements using their numeric index. Arrays are best
          suited for lists of items where the order matters and you need to
          access elements sequentially or by index. <b>Objects</b> are
          collections of key-value pairs where each key is a string, and values
          can be any type. You access object properties using their key, either
          with dot notation or bracket notation. Objects are ideal for storing
          data with named properties where you need to access values by specific
          keys rather than by an order. <br /><br />
          Array access elements by index <b>array [0]</b>, suited for ordered
          collections. Objects access properties by key <b>object.Key</b>,
          suited for unordered collections with named attributes.

        <h2 class="main-heading" id="main-heading-h2">
          Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          Function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific
          task. It allows you to encapsulate a piece of logic and execute it
          whenever needed, without having to rewrite the same code multiple
          times. In java script we define them with function keyword, name and
          parameters (if any) and then block of code. <br><br> Functions are essential in
          programming because they enhance code efficiency and clarity. They
          enable code reusability by allowing you to write a block of code once
          and reuse it, reducing duplication. Functions enhance modularity by
          dividing a program into smaller, manageable parts and provide
          abstraction by simplifying complex tasks into easy-to-use calls,
          hiding implementation details. Functions ease maintenance by
          centralizing changes and improve readability with clear names that
          define code purposes. They help manage complexity, making code more
          organized and maintainable.
