          What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          My long-term goal is to work in the IT/software development industry,
          which offers a balanced work and personal life. I am passionate about
          coding and seek a career that provides flexibility, allowing me to
          enjoy hybrid work arrangements and spend quality time with my family.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          <b>Strengths:</b> I can spend extended periods on learning with
          patience and without rushing, which helps me grasp complex concepts
          thoroughly. Additionally, having moderate tech knowledge enhances my
          ability to understand and engage with technical material effectively.
          <br />
          <b>Limitations:</b> I sometimes struggle to maintain very focused
          study sessions due to being away from studies for long periods.
          Additionally, having English as a second language can present
          challenges, and I find it difficult to say no to additional
          commitments, which can affect my focus.

          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          While at Dev Academy, I aim to develop several key non-technical
          skills. I want to improve my efficiency in managing time and tasks
          more effectively. Enhancing my problem-solving approach will help me
          tackle challenges more effectively and develop sharper decision-making
          skills for better judgment and choices. Additionally, I seek to polish
          my interpersonal skills and communication abilities to interact and
          collaborate more effectively with others.

        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          To work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and
          industry/community representatives, I will actively participate in all
          required tasks, be punctual, and respectful. I will also proactively
          ask for help when needed and offer assistance to others. Additionally,
          I will remain optimistic and open to receiving positive feedback from
          peers and facilitators, using it to make constructive changes and
          improve continuously.

          you
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          When things start building up and overwhelming me, I will dedicate
          more focus and engage in effective study sessions to address the
          challenges. Additionally, I will seek help through the proper channels
          if I need assistance with my research or any other difficulties.

          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          I will first utilize the available resources on the Dev Academy
          website. If I still need further assistance, I will research online
          and consult with fellow students. If the issue persists, I will post
          in the relevant group on Discord to seek help in a timely manner.
