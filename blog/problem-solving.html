          At first, I felt quite interested and excited as I was challenging my

          Whenever we get stuck on something, we should return to it with a
          fresh mind. We shouldn't spend too long trying to solve a problem on
          our own. Instead, it's better to seek help rather than wasting hours
          and making no progress.

          I was trying to solve the problem of removing the word "buzz" from a
          sentence, but I had to ensure it was removed in a case-insensitive
          manner. The challenge was not only filtering out the word but also
          handling different capitalizations of "buzz."

        </h2>
        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          I first thought through the steps in my mind and jotted down some
          pseudocode on a notepad. Then, I remembered that I had worked on a
          similar program before, where I used string manipulation functions
          like split() and toLowerCase(). I decided to apply a similar approach
          here by splitting the sentence, filtering out the word "buzz," and
          using toLowerCase() to handle case insensitivity.

          At first, I felt tense because I wasn't making much progress. However,
          once I remembered that I had done a similar program before, ideas
          started coming to mind, and I felt more confident about solving the
          problem.

          I learned that reflecting on past solutions can be incredibly helpful
          when tackling similar problems. It's important to remember where to
          look for solutions when you've already solved something similar. I
          also realized that planning ahead is crucial when approaching
          challenging tasks.

        <p id="main-content" style="padding: 0 25px">
          <b>Pseudocode:</b> I'm confident with pseudocode and using it as well.
          Planning and organizing thoughts before coding leads to clearer
          solutions. <br />
          <b>Trying Something:</b> I'm okay with trying new approaches, but I
          prefer to do so when I have spare time. <br />
          <b>Rubber Ducky Method:</b> I have friends with coding backgrounds to
          discuss problems with, so I haven't found the rubber ducky method
          necessary. <br />

          <b>Reading Error Messages:</b> I'm comfortable interpreting error
          messages and identifying relevant information and main errors from
          them. <br />
          <b>Console.logging:</b> I'm proficient with console.log() for checking
          outputs and understanding code behavior before finalizing solutions.
          <br />

          <b>Googling:</b> I'm good at Googling and know which key websites to
          use for finding solutions and examples. <br />
          <b>Asking Your Peers for Help:</b> I'm open to seeking help from peers
          and plan to use this support more as I progress towards the bootcamp.
          <br />
          <b>Asking Coaches for Help:</b> I'm confident in reaching out to
          facilitators when I need quick solutions or when peer-level help isn't
          sufficient. <br />
          <b>Improving Your Process with Reflection:</b> I find reflecting on
          past experiences very helpful for problem-solving and skill
          improvement. <br />

          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time

          There was a time when I was stuck on a JavaScript kata task,
          "5-builtin-methods," which involved capitalizing the first letter of
          each word. It was around midnight, and I was eager to finish the task
          before leaving. I decided not to reach out for help, thinking I should
          solve it on my own despite being stuck for a while. <br />
          <br />

          What made me reluctant was the late hour and my desire to complete the
          task independently. I thought I should be able to resolve it without
          assistance, even though it was consuming a lot of time. <br />
          <br />

          Next time, I plan to reach out for help sooner rather than spending
          excessive time struggling alone. Seeking assistance earlier can save
          time and allow me to focus on learning important concepts more
          effectively.
